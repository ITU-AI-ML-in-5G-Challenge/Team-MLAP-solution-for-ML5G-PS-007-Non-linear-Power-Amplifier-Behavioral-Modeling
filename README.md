# Team-MLAP-solution-for-ML5G-PS-007-Non-linear-Power-Amplifier-Behavioral-Modeling
Memory Polynomial-Inspired Neural Network for Modeling the Power Amplifier Non-linearities

Code:
Contains the python file for training and testing the neural network. Set the train_enable variable to 1 for training and 0 for testing.
Appropriate comments are provided in the code for understanding the steps.

Documents:
A report in .pdf format provides the motivation and the proposed network architecture and results obtained using the same.
Another .ppt file contains the same information in a presentable form.
Trained model file "memLength_11.h5" is provided with which we obtained the results as stated in the report
